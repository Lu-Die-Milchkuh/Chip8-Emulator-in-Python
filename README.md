# Chip8-Emulator-in-Python
Basic Chip 8 Emulator/Interpreter with a generic GUI

This is my first "bigger" coding project so dont be too hard to me :)

I made a basic Chip8 Interpreter(so no Super Chip 8 opcodes!) and simple Launcher GUI(which is not finished :) )

If you want to finish it and/or improve it,do so
