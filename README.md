# Chip8-Emulator-in-Python
Basic Chip 8 Emulator/Interpreter with a generic GUI

This is my first "bigger" coding project so dont be too hard on me :)

I made a basic Chip8 Interpreter(so no Super Chip 8 opcodes!) and simple Launcher GUI(which is not finished :) )

If you want to finish it and/or improve it,do so
               
What I used :  - 100 % Python
               - Tkinter for GUI Launcher
               - Pygame for Graphic-Output and Keyboard Input
               
Controls :  I used the original Chip 8 keyboard layout so a Chip 8 "A" is a normal "a" , a Chip 8 "1"  is a normal "1" on your keyboard
